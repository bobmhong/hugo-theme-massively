Your own 150ft private beach is the perfect place to relax, swim, and enjoy the sun, or hunt for treasured Petoskey stones, fossils, and driftwood. You'll delight in kayaking, paddle boarding, or boating along the shore and in the bay.

In the distance you'll see Beaver Island, several lighthouses, and Waugoshance Island at the western extent of Wildernes State Park.

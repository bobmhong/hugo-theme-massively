The sunporch offers a cozy spot to experience the outdoors without stepping outside. Feel the warmth of the southern sun as you read a book, or relax in the swing and watch the water. The porch is a great place for sharing a glass of wine, playing cards with friends, or having family game night. The versatile screen system opens 3/4 of the window height for fresh lakeside breezes and shuts securely to keep out the elements.

Wildlife at the cottage is abundant and diverse. Deer, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, & foxes are among those visitors you may spot. Bird lovers are in for a real treat. In the fields and woods, you’ll hear a bountiful array of songbirds. The hoot of an owl and woodpeckers working on a hollow tree are a normal part of the regular soundscape. 

As with most large bodies of water, the sound of gulls is not unusual but there’s more northern Michigan charm in store. On summer evenings you can wind down to the soothing sound of loons, with their “Marco-Polo” like call and response.

Fall brings migrating flocks of birds to the bay, stopping for a rest and meal before moving on to warmer waters. Most recently, about 300 Common Merganser Ducks were transient guests of the bay for a few days in late September 2023.

The biggest thrill for most is seeing the resident bald eagles in their natural setting. Whether searching the coastline on their morning patrol, eating a freshly caught salmon on the beach, or majestically soaring over the bay, the bald eagles will almost certainly evoke a sense of awe and respect.

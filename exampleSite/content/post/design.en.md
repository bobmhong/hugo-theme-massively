The mono-pitch design features clean lines, charcoal exterior, and a low profile that subtly blends into the natural surroundings.
Environmental impact was minimized with a modest footprint, high energy efficiency, sustainable steel siding and roofing, and embracing the native plant species of the forest and dune.

## Designed for now and years ahead...

You'll likely find that the cottage has an ample amount of living space for weekend trips and extended getaways. But what if you'd like more room to accomodate extended family or to make it your permanent home? The cottage was designed to easily add an optional master suite and bedroom wing.  The architect/owner is available to collaboratively design the cottage or home of your dreams.

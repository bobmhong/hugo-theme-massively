At the end of Michigan's famed M-119 "Tunnel of Trees" and a few miles past the quaint town of Cross Village, you'll find the cottage nestled among the hardwoods on the Lake Michigan shore.

When you're not enjoying the beach, there are plenty of things to do in the area. Just a few steps out the door, you'll find a large trail network including seasonal roads, the North Country Trail, and Wilderness State Park. The trails are great for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. The area is also great for bird watching and mushroom hunting.

Cross Village is home to a general store, a gas station, a few restaurants, art gallery, farm market, and a post office. The town is also home to the Legs Inn, a Polish restaurant that has been featured on the Food Network. You will also find the Petoskey Brewing Company. Both restaurants are open seasonally in the warmer months.

A short drive to the south you'll see expansive views of valleys, farms, and forests. You'll climb and twist through the hills towards Pleasantville where you'll find Nubs Nob and The Highlands ski resorts.

Continue south to visit the charming and popular lakeside communities of Harbor Springs, Petoskey, and Charlevoix. Along the way, you'll find something for everyone: farm markets, wineries, galleries, restaurants, shopping, and more.
